# What is Mr. Smiley Head's Safari 2?
This mod is a Total Conversion mod which offers new levels, monsters, weapons, and player classes to play with.
Development started in 2014 (July) just as something to spend time. Eventually this mod turned into bigger and bigger every year.
The theme of this mod is random, it has Power Rangers, Barneys, dead Doomguy, stupid and joke sounds, and so on.
Goal is to somewhat keep that 90s feeling, when at that time was considered famous, nowadays it is forgotten in the shadows.

## Building the pk3:
Windows:

After you downloaded the zip, don't forget to extract the folder, then run the BUILD.bat file in order to build the Mr_SmileyII.pk3 file
The pk3 file will be placed where you ran the BUILD.bat file in the first place
ie.: "C:\Users\Your_Username\Desktop\Mr_SmileyII\Mr_SmileyII.pk3"

# Unix:
Same as for Windows, but instead of build.bat, run the "build" file which will build the PK3 for you
_________________________________________________________________
Without building the pk3:

Extract the .zip file to the desktop (or anywhere else), then drag the folder over GZDoom.exe
(I don't know If this will work on Unix systems)
